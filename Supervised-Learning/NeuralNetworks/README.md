# About the Neural Networks

Neural networks are a mathematical tool capable of modeling (in a simplified way) the functioning of brain neurons. Like biological neural networks, these artificial neurons interconnect to form a network of artificial neurons between them.

According to _[1]_ _"An artificial neural network, also called a neurocomputer, (\ ldots), is a massively interconnected, distributed parallel processor that stores experimental knowledge"_.

According to _[2]_ \ cite {camperos2006redes}, artificial neural networks have the following characteristics:

* Knowledge is acquired experimentally through a training process based on input and output data representing various classes.
* The interconnect weights (_Also known as **synapse**, where in a biological neuron generates electrical impulses and transfers information to other neurons via the synapse; information travels along axons in brief electrical pulses [3]_.) constantly vary when the network is in a training phase. Once the training is finished and having obtained the optimal weights we can make predictions without changing the weights.
