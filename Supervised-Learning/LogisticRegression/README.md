# About: Logistic regression

According to _[1]_ the logistic regression: "_It is a method that models the probabilities of classification problems with two possible results. This model is an extension of the linear regression model but applied to classification problems"_.

As we well know, logistic regression is a classification method. This type of method introduces an additional non-linearity on a linear classifier, this is expressed in the following way:

using a logistic function also called **[sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function)**. The logistic regression classifier is defined using the following equation:
